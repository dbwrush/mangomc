## Plot Claiming

When you log into the Survival world you will be given a Golden Shovel which will let you claim land. The amount of land you may claim starts small but increases as you play.
Land you claim will be protected from griefing, and you can share it with other players by running /trust. You can read more about GriefPrevention [here](https://docs.griefprevention.com/).

## Shopkeepers

Players may use Shopkeepers to exchange items with other players. A Shopkeeper spawn egg can be purchased at the spawnpoint for the price of 5 diamonds. Read about the ShopKeepers plugin [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/shopkeepers).
