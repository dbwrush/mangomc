# Minigames

MangoMC is always looking to improve our selection in minigames. Currently we have 2 custom minigames created by [sudologic](https://sudologic.net).

## ElytraDogfights

![Elytra Dogfights](/images/elytra.png)

An aerial combat minigame created by [sudologic](https://sudologic.net), players spawn into a large spherical arena and dogfight to be the last individual or team flying. Hold 'Q' to rapid-fire, use the slime blocks to get a boost, and avoid getting caught in the cobwebs!
If you want to add this plugin on your own server you can download it from [spigotmc.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/elytra-dogfights.60491/)

## Ledges

![Ledges](/images/ledges.jpg)

Loosely inspired by _Super Smash Bros_, Ledges is a game about knockback. Each hit you take increases the amount of knockback you will take until you fall off the ledges. View your stats by running the /showleaderboard command.
