Our Creative plotworld gives players an open canvas to build together.

## How-to claim plots
Players may claim plots using either "/plotme auto" or "/plot claim". Plots can also be merged if you need more space.
You can give other players permission to build in your plot using "/plot add". Read more about the PlotSquared plugin at [spigotmc.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plotsquared-v6.77506/)
